                                    Introduction


               CenCit is a room type Bulletin Board (BBS) system.
             Originally derived from a game in the University of Washington 
             mainframe system, the software has progressed over the years 
             to become one of the best Citadel BBS systems available.

	       This software is the work of many hands, I'd like to take a
	     moment to give credit to those I know of that have worked on
	     it. Unfortunately, most of the BBS authors who work on
	     Citadels use pseudonyms (nyms in Citadel terminology), thus I
	     can only mention the names I know.  Cynbe ru Taren (A.K.A.
	     Crt) is the Father of Citadel.  He wrote the first version
	     under CP/M.  Details of this are in the begin.hlp and
	     history.hlp file. Gremlin produced the first MS-DOS version of
	     Citadel (which ran only on CP/M systems prior to that),
	     Dragon, Ray Johnson, Z'ton and Joe Broxson created the version
	     called DragCit.  Ray Johnson went on to create TurboCit.
	     TurboCit is now commercial BBS software. FredCit was derived
	     from the only public release of TurboCit source code. Zen
	     Master and Fred did the early work on FredCit with occasional
	     routines donated by Zen Master, Jeremiah Johnson, and others.
	     Fred released his source code at a time when it was fairly
	     stable.  I (Centauri) got such a public release and have
	     continued to enhance this software. Thanks to all, (including
	     those I've neglected to mention, or don't know about), for
	     your contributions.  I'd also like to thank other public
	     domain authors for their public domain source code releases,
	     which have helped improve CenCit. These include: Marty Del
	     Vecchio for his swap code, (SWAP.ASM), Wayne Conrad for the
	     serial drivers (IBMCOM.PAS), and RAC for the conversion of
	     these drivers to C.

                                 Installation


               Installation can take some time.  Be patient, the results
             are well worth it.


                                 2.1  Basics


               First of all, create a "HOMEPATH" directory on your drive 
             (remember the name of this, you will need it later).  Then 
             install the files from the release zip files into the 
             appropriate directories on your hard drive.  Use the -d option 
             to PKUNZIP for this, so that the directories contained in the 
             .ZIP files will be created.

               Example:

                    c:
                    md \ccit
                    cd \ccit
                    pkunzip -d a:\ccit112.zip c:\ccit
                    pkunzip -d a:\ccitfile.zip c:\ccit

               Use the appropriate names for CCIT112.ZIP (changes with each
             release), and CCITFILE.ZIP.  

               PKUNZIP will create other paths that citadel will look for.
             These are referred to as "TEMPPATH", "APPLICATION", "MSGPATH",
             "TEMPPATH", and "ROOMPATH".

               The default paths are:

               c:\ccit            HOMEPATH
               c:\ccit\MSG        MSGPATH
               c:\ccit\HLP        HELPPATH
               c:\ccit\ROOM       ROOMPATH
               c:\ccit\TEMP       TEMPPATH
               c:\ccit\APLIC      APPLICATIONS

               You make change these paths by editing the CONFIG.CIT and
             creating different directories. If you do, make sure no path
             is a root directory. If you want to use a ram disk, for your
             TEMPPATH you need to make a directory on that disk to use.  If



                                            7






             you do change these, it is very important that you do not have
             the same path for HOMEPATH and TEMPPATH.


          2.2  Your AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files


                 Before you attempt to run CenCit, look at your CONFIG.SYS
             file on your boot drive.  The FILES setting should be at least
             20.  If there is no FILES line in your CONFIG.SYS, add the
             following line to it with an ASCII text editor:

                    FILES=20

               There are a couple of options that may be set in your
             AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  These are called "87" and "TZ".

               TZ sets your time zone name (three characters, and the
             offset from Greenwich mean time).  87 allows you to tell
             CenCit if an 80x87 coprocessor exists in your system.  If you
             do not set a value here, the BBS system will test for the
             presence of a coprocessor at start up.  If you have a BBS in
             the Pacific Standard time zone, and no 80x87 coprocessor, you
             would use these lines in your AUTOEXEC.BAT:

                    SET 87=N
                    SET TZ=PST8

               For daylight time, you would use:

                    SET TZ=PDT8

               Note, this will change as soon as a time zone related bug in
             the C compiler I use is fixed.


          2.3  Your .CIT Files


               Citadel uses a very flexible (and sometimes confusing)
             configuration method.  Most editable parameters are kept in
             files with the extension .CIT.  Except for FILEINFO.CIT, all
             .CIT files are editable text files.  Each of these files
             contains information on what the parameters do.

             CONFIG.CIT     System Configuration

             CRON.CIT       Time based events

             EXTERNAL.CIT   External programs & protocols

             GRPDATA.CIT    Accounting data

             NODES.CIT      Networking data



                                            8






             ROUTE.CIT      Networked mail paths

               All .CIT file parameters start with a '#' character as the
             very first character on the line.  Anything else will disable
             the parameter.  Parameters consisting of more then one word
             should be quoted, and more then one value may be specified on
             a single line where noted.  C language style escape characters
             in quoted strings are supported.  Be careful with this, to
             specify a path in a quoted string, you will need to double up
             the '\' characters.  Thus, C:\CCIT\APLIC becomes
             "C:\\CCIT\\APLIC" when quoted.  Some control characters can be
             inserted in parameters by using '^' as a prefix.  Control-G
             would become ^G in a quoted string.

               You will eventually need to edit all of the .CIT files
             except the FILEINFO.CIT files.  These files all contain
             comments describing the parameters in them.  Start out with
             CONFIG.CIT.  Most of the defaults for these parameters should
             be usable.  Pay careful attention to the path parameters, as
             no special error checking is done on these.  The paths must
             exist!  I recommend you use a drive letter when specifying any
             path.  If you do not intend to network your board, you can
             ignore ROUTE.CIT and NODES.CIT.


                       2.4  CCit Command Line Options


               Several options are available when you start CenCit from
             the DOS command line.  The general format is:

                    CCIT [options]

               Options can be specified in any order.  Options can be in
             upper or lower case, and may be prefixed with '-' or '/'.  The
             '-?' command line option displays all of the valid command
             line options and arguments.

               Valid DOS command line options (switches) are:

                    -b baud   Starting baud rate (300-19200).  This is
                              needed when running in shell/door mode from
                              another BBS.

                    -c        Read configuration files and rebuild .DAT
                              files.

                    -d        DesqView/TopView (not working yet).

                    -e        Use EMS memory for overlays (faster!).

                    -l pass   Log in with the "initials;password" (pass) if
                              the accout exists.




                                            9






                    -p num    Set output pacing to num milliseconds between
                              characters.  Intended for PC emulation on the
                              Atari ST.

                    -s        Run as a shell from another BBS.  This
                              suppresses hang-up and modem initialization.

                    -u name   Log in the named user, if the account exists.

                    -v        Just run cron events and exit back to DOS.

                    -x        Use extended memory for overlays.  Due to
                              hardware problems with the 80286
                              microprocessor, this option only works on
                              80386 or 80486 systems.

                    -?        Displays command line options.

                                 Networking


               Portions of this section derived from Z'ton's NETWORK.DOC.

               Compatible Citadels can exchange messages in one or more
             rooms via networking.  There are several steps to setting up a
             network link between two boards:

                    Set up the node accounts on each board

                    Edit your network setup in NODES.CIT

                    Add a time based (CRON) NETWORK event in CRON.CIT

                    Test the network link

               Before you network, you need to find a node to network with.
             It's helpful to net with someone who has had experience
             setting up netting.  Look at the GRID.HLP file for numbers of
             public BBS's if you don't currently know anyone helpful on the
             net.  Most of these boards carry rooms where you can get your
             questions answered, and find other Citadels to network with.
             Most of these boards will net with you, so don't be shy!
             Currently, our network is active in Seattle, Dallas,
	     Washington DC, the bay area (CA), and Nashville.  We are
	     looking for new areas to network to.

               Networking requires a Hayes compatible modem (or near
             compatible) that will hang up when the DTR line is lowered.
             (See your modem technical reference manual for appropriate
             settings on your modem).  This section assumes you have
             already made the file transfer protocol work.  See the notes
             in the top if EXTERNAL.CIT for more information on how to do
             this.


                       3.1  Setting up a node account


               To net two boards each board needs an account on the other.
             Log in on your system as a new user with the initials and
             password the other board will use.  Remember these, you will
             need them later.  The new name should exactly match the other
             boards name.  Terminate.  Log-in as a sysop and .SU (Sysop
             Userlog) the new account, making that it is a NODE account.



                                           11






             Also give them the groups needed to get into any room they
             want to network (.SGU).

               This must be done on both boards for the net to function.


                           3.2  Node File Entries


               Edit the file NODES.CIT with any editor that will save to a
             normal text file.  In this file contains information on all
             the nodes that your board nets with.  Look in NODES.CIT for
             more information on this.

               Nodes entry file format:

               #NODE         "Node Name" "Region Name"
               #PHONE        "555-5555"
               #BAUD         2400
               #DIAL_TIMEOUT 30
               #REDIAL       3
               #LOGIN        W "als:" S "initials;password"
               #WAIT_TIMEOUT 15
               #PROTOCOL     "Zmodem"
               #MAIL_TMP     "Nodename.mai"
               #EXPIRE       25
               #GROUP        "Your Group" "Their Group"
               #ROOM         "Your Room"  "Their Room"

                                3.2.1  #NODE

               The name and region of the node you want to net with.  All
             names are quoted strings of 30 characters or less each.  The
             region is not used in message transfer.  Make sure the node
             name exactly matches the name in your BBS's user log.  Also
             make sure the node and region names match those of the remote
             system.

                               3.2.2  #PHONE

               The phone number for your modem to dial in order to reach
             the other BBS.  Must be a quoted string of thirty characters
             or less.  First dial this number manually, and make darn sure
             it's a modem on the other end.  If you have any problems,
             check again.  We don't want to harass the electronic non
             entities out there (read: people without modems).

                                3.2.3  #BAUD

               The baud rate to connect to the other system at. This must
             be in the range of 300 to 19200.






                                           12






                            3.2.4  #DIAL_TIMEOUT

               The number of seconds before giving up on connecting to the
             other board.  Use a number here, usually 30-45 seconds, longer
             in some areas.

                               3.2.5  #REDIAL

               The number of times to attempt the dial out before quitting.

                               3.2.6  #LOGIN

               A script to log you into the remote board.  Use the initials
             and password you created your board's account on the remote
             system with.  Allowed commands in this script are:

                    P seconds Pause, dumping modem input

                    S "text"  Send text

                    W "text"  Wait for text

                    ! "program"    Run a program

                            3.2.7  #WAIT_TIMEOUT

               The number of seconds to wait for the log-in script W
             command text to come in.  This normally translates into the
             amount of time it takes a log-in to fail (sometimes called
             "Zombie Modem").

                              3.2.8  #PROTOCOL

               The name of the protocol to use from EXTERNAL.CIT.

                              3.2.9  #MAIL_TMP

               A path for all mail being routed to this board.  I'm planing
             a future enhancement to automatically place all of this in a
             subdirectory.  Please use a simple file name here for now.

                              3.2.10  #EXPIRE

               Oldest message in days.  This is the age of oldest message
             that will be accepted over the network.  Older messages will
             be 'expired', and do not appear in your message base.  To
             avoid duplicates, do not use a number larger the your message
             base's oldest possible message.  If you haven't been running
             your BBS long enough to "scroll" your message base, use a
             reasonable number, such as 30.  If you have already filled
             your message base at least once, you can check to see how
             often the message base scrolls.  To check for this, log in as
             a sysop, and do the command ".R#".  Accept the default value
             for the message number to read.  This will be the oldest



                                           13






             message currently on your system.  Calculate the number of
             days old this message is, and use that value here.

                               3.2.11  #GROUP

               You may have any number of #GROUP lines, up the the total
             number of groups your system may contain (64).  The first name
             is the name of the group on your system.  The second name is
             the group name on the system you net with.  These usually are
             the same, but you can use these to convert a group name.  The
             #GROUP lines affect networked, group only messages.  These
             messages will only be visible to members of the group.  You
             may enter a networked, group only message by using the .EG or
             .EL commands in a networked room.  The names used here are
             quoted strings of 30 characters or less.

                               3.2.12  #ROOM

               As with #GROUP, you can have as many #ROOM lines as you
             want, up to the number of rooms in your system (maximum 255).
             These lines determine which rooms exchange messages.  The
             first room name is the networked room on your system, the
             second is the networked room on the remote system.  It is wise
             to use the same name in both places when the room is widely
             netted.   This prevents "cross netted" rooms, where the
             contents of one room inadvertently end up in another room.

               On many boards a privately netted room is created for each
             node netted to.  You might want to try this.  On each board,
             create a networked room, (using the .ER and .AE commands),
             named after the other board.  Then each board adds a #ROOM
             line like:

                    #ROOM     "Their BBS name"    "Your BBS name"

               This will map the messages from their board into a room on
             your BBS named after their board, and your messages into a
             room on their BBS named after yours.

               Make sure that the other board's account has access to all
             of the rooms netted.  If any of the networked rooms are group
             only type rooms, you will need to check the other board's
             group access vs the groups of the rooms involved.  If any of
             the rooms are hidden, log in under the node's account, and do
             a .goto to the room before netting.

               The other sysop MUST create a matching room list, or else
             the messages will not net both ways.  A telephone conversation
             while editing these files helps greatly.  Notice that the room
             lists on the two systems will be the same, with the room name
	     columns reversed.	Nodesed is VERY useful here.

                            3.3  The Route File


               Edit the file ROUTE.CIT.  Examples of the formats allowed:

	       #ROUTE	       "Fred's Toy"         "Centauri's Place"
	       #ROUTE	       "TurboTech"          "Centauri's Place"
	       #ALIAS	       "Fred"               "Fred's Toy"
               #ALIAS          "Cen"                "Centauri's Place"
	       #DEFAULT_ROUTE  "Centauri's Place"

                               3.3.1  #ROUTE

               You may have any number of #ROUTE lines.  These lines define
             where mail for systems you do NOT net with goes.  Make sure
             you do not have a #ROUTE line for any systems you directly
             network with.  The first name is the board the mail is
             destined for.  The second name is the board that the mail will
             actually be sent to, in route to the destination board.  It is
             best to use the name of a board directly netted to the
             destination board in the second position, wherever possible.
             The second name must be a board you directly network with, and
             must exactly match the spelling of the boards account name in
             your user log.

                               3.3.2  #ALIAS

               BBS aliases (often known as 'zips'), are used when entering
             network mail with the .EE command.  For example, if you were
             sending mail to "Centauri @ Centauri's Place", you might enter 
             "Centauri @ Cen" instead.  To do this, you would need a #ALIAS 
             line like the example above.

                           3.3.3  #DEFAULT_ROUTE

               If set, the default route is where mail is sent, when you
             don't directly net with the destination board, and no #ROUTE
             line exists for the destination BBS.  The default route BBS
             name should be a board that your system directly networks
             with.  Be sure the spelling exactly matches the boards log-in
             name.


                       3.4  Testing the Network Link


               After completing the above sections, and editing the
             CRON.CIT file (see the Time Based Events chapter), you are
             ready to test the network link.

               First of all, check the telephone number you entered in
             NODES.CIT.  Make sure you are not calling someone's voice line
             by mistake, and the there is a modem on the other end giving
             you that nasty carrier squeal.





                                           15






               Do a .SCL (Sysop Cron List) to view the cron table.  Make
             sure the NETWORK entry for the board you're netting with is in
             there.  If it isn't, do a .SCE (Sysop Cron Enter) to load the
             cron file.

               Log out, if you're logged in.

               Press ALT-E.  This will start off the next cron event.  Any
             key press after this will abort a network attempt.  If
             necessary, you can use .SCL to see what's going on.  The
             command .SCR (Sysop Cron Reset) can be used to cause a 'done'
             event to be ready to run again.

               Watch the screen!

               First, your system will attempt to dial the remote system.
             If you have problems getting past this step, use ALT-D to turn
             on debug mode.  The system will then display the modem
             response codes.  Common problems here are:

                    Wrong #MDATA port number in CONFIG.CIT (the board would
                    never answer if you have this problem.

                    Incorrect phone number.  Remember that long distance
                    calls require a 1 and sometimes an area code.  Some
                    PBX's require a 9 be dialed to first get an outside
                    line.  Use commas for delays if needed here.

                    A mismatch between the modem response codes set up in
                    DUMB_MODEM in CONFIG.CIT and the modem switch settings.

               After the dial out, and log-in to the remote board, the
             system will attempt to run your communications protocol
             several times.  Common problems here are:

                             Time Based Events


               A time based (CRON) event is a command that Citadel will run
             every so often using the commands in the CRON.CIT file.  This
             file controls automatic networking, and any time based
             programs you may want to play with (usually a batch file).

               Citadel checks about every 3 minutes to see if anything is
             going on.  If anything has happened in the last 3 minutes,
             Citadel continues to wait.  But if nothing has happened in 3
             minutes it checks it's CRON.CIT file.  If there is an event to
             run, Citadel will run the event.  If not, it resets the modem
             and nothing else happens.


                        4.1  Editing the CRON events


               Cron file format:

               #DO          NETWORK    "Node Name"
               #HOURS       ANY
               #DAYS        ANY
               #REDO_TIME   480
               #RETRY_TIME  0

                                 4.1.1  #DO

               Several types of cron events can be specified in the #DO
             command.  The format for the #DO line must be one of these
             four formats:

                    #DO SHELL_1 "program"

                    #DO NETWORK "Node Name"

                    #DO LOCAL   "Node Name"

                    #DO EXIT    0

               SHELL_1 events are used for running external programs.
             These events are cleared whenever the program event runs.  The
             format for the program line is flexible, and defined in
             CRON.CIT.

               NETWORK events are used for firing off a network linkup
             between two boards.  This type of event is cleared when the
             network link completes.
        
                               4.1.2  #HOURS

               This defines the hours during which the event can happen.
             Valid hours are 0-23, or Any.  You can have more then one hour
             on a single #HOUR line.  To have a program run somewhere
             between 1 AM and 3 AM when there is time, use a #HOURS line
             like:

                    #HOURS 1 2 3

               To allow the event to happen at any hour, use:

                    #HOURS Any

                                4.1.3  #DAYS

               This defines the days the event can happen on.  Valid days
             are Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri,Sat,Sun, or Any.  You can have more
             then one day on a single #DAY line.  To have an event only run
             on weekends, use a #DAY line like:

                    #DAY Sat Sun

               To allow the event to happen on any day, use:

                    #DAY Any

                             4.1.4  #REDO_TIME

               This is the minimum number of minutes the BBS will wait
             before it will attempt the event again after successfully
             completing it.

                             4.1.5  #RETRY_TIME

               This is the minimum number of minutes the BBS will wait
             before attempting a network event again after it fails.
