 The Capabilites for ANSI Music and sound effects make for some interesting
 messages.  The SysOp has provided a maximum number of messages per visit
 that may have sound.  If you try to enter Music or Sound and the system
 beeps, it is for one of the following reasons:
 1) 	You have exceeded the maximum number of sound-containing messages.
 2) 	You did not Enter an M,S or E after the ^B (control B).
 3) 	You do not have sound enabled in your configuration.

	 To enter a Musical Score:
		 Type ^BM
		 then the Octave, note length, and notes.
		 Type ^BE

	 To enter a sound effect:
		 Type ^BS
		 then a sequence of frequencys and durations
		 Type ^BE

 2A-G0[#,+,-]     A-G are notes. # or + following a note produces a sharp.
                - produces a flat.
 2L0(n)           Sets the length of each note. L4 is a quarter note, L1 is
                a whole note. n may be from 1 to 64. Length may also follow
                a note.  C#8 is C Sharp as an eigth note.
 2O0              Octave O sets the current octave. There are 7 octaves
                (0 through 6). Default is 4. Middle C is at the beginning
                of octave 3.
 2P0              Pause (like a note only no sound - known as a rest)
 2T0(n)           Tempo. T sets the number of L4s in a minute.  The default
                tempo is 120 and may range from 32 to 255.
 2.0(period)      A period after a note increases the playing time of the
                note by 3/2 times the period determined by L (length of the
                note) times T (tempo).  Multiple periods can appear after
                a note and the playing time is scaled accordingly.For
                example, A. will cause the note A to play one and a half
                times the playing time determined by L (length of the note)
                times T (the tempo); two periods placed after the A (A..)
                will cause the note to be played at 9/4 times its ascribed
                value; an A with three periods (A...) at 27/8, etc.

 2>n0             A greater-than symbol preceding the note n plays the note
                in the next higher octave.
 2<n0             A less-than symbol preceding the note n plays the note
                in the next lower octave.


  ALL SOUND NOTES MUST BE IN UPPER CASE!!! This is critical to the sucess of
  your sound effect or music.

 2F0n             Frequency where n is a number between 20 and 32767.
 2D0n             Duration where n is a millisecond count (1000 is 1 second)
