  Commands work two ways:  single-key and multiple-key.  To enter a
single-key command, simply press that key.  To enter multiple-key
commands, press the '.' key, the key for that command, and any parameters.

  Most single-key commands are default forms of multiple-key commands.
For example, typing G will goto the next room with new messages, while
.G(roomname) will go to the room (roomname).

  Typical commands commonly used include:

    2L0 -- Will login to the system.
    2N0 -- Will read new messages in a room.
    2E0 -- Will let you enter a message.
    2G0 -- Will go to the next room with unread messages.
    2T0 -- Will log you off and hangup.

  .2EE0 -- Will let you enter a private message.
  .2ER0 -- Will let you create a new room.
  .2EC0 -- Will let you change your terminal configuration.
  .2TS0 -- Will log you off without hanging up, someone with you can
         login without having to call back.

  To get a list of options for each command, you can
