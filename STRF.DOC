        This file and the program STRF.EXE are provided to help you
    configure your time/date stamp for CenCit.	It takes the format string
    as a command line argument, using quotes if it contains spaces.  There is
    an 80 character limit on the final output.

    EXAMPLE:  STRF "%B %d %Y, %I:%M:%S %p %Z"

       Note:  4DOS Users:
    EXAMPLE:  STRF `"%B %d %Y, %I:%M:%S %p %Z"`

              A normal DOS time/date stamp for 12/30/88 10:05:00 PST
              would become:

              December 30 1988, 10:05:00 AM PST

    NOTE:     The time zone may be reset by putting this command line in
              the autoexec.bat file.

              set TZ=XXX#XXX
                      ^ ^ ^
                      | | \ optional second time zone name.
                       \ \  number of hours difference from GMT. 8 for PST.
                        \   Time zone name.

              set TZ=EST5EDT
