                              Introduction

        I originally wrote this program because once a user log is created 
     there is no way to make it smaller except for one very drastic measure.
     Destroying the log and start over!   That is, until now.


                                 Usage

        This program will read your current log size defined in config.cit 
     and begin reading the userlog data.  It will then sort the entries by 
     call number (the same order users show in .Read Userlog).  It will 
     inform you of total log size, total number of valid log entries and 
     total of those that are permanent entries. You will be asked to 
     provide the new log size.  It cannot be the same as the current size 
     or less than the total number of permanent users. If you are 
     downsizing, the program will begin displaying the user names, call 
     number and special flags (Aide, Unlisted, Permanent, Sysop, Node). At 
     the point where you specified the new log size, there will be a break 
     in the list and you will be informed that the rest of the entries will 
     be purged (deleted).  The list will continue to the end. You will be 
     asked if this is ok.   This gives you a chance to go back into your 
     Citadel and make changes. You may have seen names that you want to 
     make permanent so they do not get purged.  You may also have seen 
     names that you wish to remove permanent status. Once you enter 'y' to 
     the "Is this ok? (y/n) " question,  the program writes the data to 
     disk and forces re-configuration of the Citadel.  You are also told to 
     edit the config.cit file and put the new log size in the entry marked 
     #MAXLOGTAB.
        
        DO NOT FORGET to edit config.cit!  It will insure the success of
     your new log size.
