 CITADEL -- updated 90 Feb 05 -------

   Citadel is a set of BBS/GDS (Bulletin Board System/General Discussion
System) software systems. The concept of Citadel is to divide the messages
placed on the system into natural divisions, at the discretion of the
authors of the messages, and to use the metaphor of rooms to do so.
 
  Please feel free to look around and if you have any specific questions
leave them in Notes to the SysOp.
