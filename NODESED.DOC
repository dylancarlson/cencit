                                 Usage
       
       This program may be used to edit existing node entries in the 
     nodes.cit file or create new ones.  It also will read an optional data 
     file from another sysop for networking purposes allowing you to add 
     your group and room names to the ones shown from the other system.
       If you have indented lines in a current node, they will not be read 
     in by this editor.  They will, however be written back to your 
     nodes.cit file.  All unrecognized fields will be written back to the 
     nodes.cit file even though the editor will not process them.  This 
     program can also be used to create the data file needed by a new node 
     to be read in at their site.

                            The Line Editor                              
       Every prompt in the system except help screens and error windows 
     employ a very special line editor.  You can, with this line editor, 
     change any part of a prompt without having to re-type it.
       The summary of commands follows:
                       
           Home                        Beginning of line
           End                         End of line
           Cursor left                 Left one character
           Cursor right                Right on character
           Control Cursor left         Left one word
           Control Cursor right        Right one word
           Insert                      Toggle Insert mode on/off                   
           Delete                      Delete character under cursor  
           Backspace                   Delete character before cursor
                                         
                              
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                 - 1 -
                            
                            
                            The Line Editor                              
                              (Continued)                              
                              
       You will also notice that if a prompt is wider than the window, that 
     the input "scrolls" sideways.  This allows you to input more than 
     would fit on a single line.  Up and down arrow keys may be used to get 
     to previously entered data.  Page Up and Page down may also be used to 
     quickly access multiple pages of data.  A summary of the help may be 
     seen by entering Alt H.  Individual help for each line may be seen by 
     entering Alt F (if the help exists).  
       
       The following is a description of the special functions:
     
       Alt M allows you to move the window around the screen with the 
     cursor keys. Use the Escape key when the window is where you want 
     it.  Alt C allows you to change various things about a window.  You 
     may change a windows foreground color, background color, border 
     color, border type, appearance type, and shadow type.  Alt Z will 
     bring up a help window explaining the function keys needed to change 
     the window once you have entered Alt C.  Alt D brings up an on-line 
     calender that can be scrolled through.  Left and right cursor move a 
     day at a time, up and down cursor move a week at a time, page up and 
     page down move a month at a time, and finally, home and end move a 
     year at a time.
                              
				NodeConv
       This program is a simple data-to-text and text-to-data file
     conversion program for those of you without QuickNet capabilites.
       Simply type in nodeconv and answer the prompts for the filenames.
     
       To send your new data to another site convert the data file to text 
     and merge it into an E-Mail message for the other SysOp.  Since the 
     conversion program looks specifically for two double quotes at the 
     beginning and end of the actual new node data, you are free to put 
     comments in this message before and after the merged in text file.  DO 
     NOT alter this data by removing the space at the beginning of the line 
     or by removing any of the double quotes or the other site will not be 
     able to convert the text data back to an internal structure.
                              
       If you are the recipient of the E-Mail message you will need to 
     capture this message to disk. (Most Citadels either have a capture to 
     disk function or you could turn your print file on and re-display the 
     message).   Then run nodeconv.
     
                              Installation 
       Copy this program into your DOS path or your Citadel home directory. 
     This program MUST be run in your home directory as it needs to be able 
     to read "nodes.cit" and "config.cit".
