  2HELP GROUP0

  Groups are sets of users.  Messages, Rooms, and Hallways can be limited
to a selected group, and users may belong to more than one group.  The
commands to create rooms and messages which are limited to a group are as
follows:

  .2ELM0  or .2EG0  -- To create a group-only message.
  .2ELR0  -- To create a group-only room.

  After both of these, you will be prompted for a group name.  You can
limit a message or room to any group which you are a member of.  To find
out which groups you belong to, use the Read Configuration command noted
elsewhere. And the Read Limited Access Userlog.
