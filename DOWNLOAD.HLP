  (and files in general...)
  Download functions are available in special rooms called directory rooms.
Directory rooms have a "]" after the roomname, rather than the normal ">"
character.  The following commands are used to list files, to download them,
or to upload files:

  .2RA0  -- Read Archive contents
  .2RVA0 -- Read Verbose Archive
  .2RD0  -- Read Directory
  .2RVD0 -- Read Verbose Directory
  .2RI0  -- Read Infofile
  .2RVI0 -- Read Verbose Infofile

  The Read Archive command with show the contents of an ARC file.

  The Read Directory and Infofile commands list the available files in the
current room.  This commands waits for an optional filename (possibly
wildcarded, per MS-DOS filename conventions) and will restrict its output
to those files selected.  The default is to list all of the files.

  The Verbose option gives an extended listing with date, filesize in bytes
and download time.

  .2RT0  -- Read Textfile
  .2RW0  -- Read WC-Protocol
  2D0    -- Download

  These commands download files.  Read Textfile will request a filename,
file will be printed (as is) to you.  Read WC-Protocol will download a file 
using XMODEM protocol, and the Download command will let you choose a 
protocol. 

  .2ET0  -- Enter Textfile  (Terminate Entering a Textfile with control-Z)
  .2EW0  -- Enter WC-Protocol
  2U0    -- Upload

  These commands are the inverse of the above two download commands.  They
actually create files on the local system.  After supplying the filename,
you will be asked to supply a brief comment describing the file.  You have
about 60 characters.
