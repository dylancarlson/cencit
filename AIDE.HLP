  3.AA0-ttributes  - Sets a file in a directory to hidden/read only.
  3.AC0-hat     - Overrides nochat.  Allows you to page the sysop.
  3.AE0-dit room (Default) - Edit an existing room

3*0   3A0-pplication:- Do you want this room to have an application?
     An application is any program that is run in a shell of the system.
     You are though limited to the size of the program, since the system
     does take up some space when you shell.
                   If [Y], system will respond:
                   Enter Application filename
                   Must have (filename.ext) Extension is optional.
     Applications may be batch files, com files, or exe files.  They
     must be in the #APLICPATH as found in your config.cit file.
     You are only allowed one application per room.
     Putting an "!" in front of the filename will cause Cit to write message
     and log tab files to disk to give you maximium free memory for an
     application.
     Putting an "@" in front of the filename will cause Cit to not clear the
     screen when invoking an application.  Should be use only with programs
     that save screen information.

     3C0-hange name:- Do you want to change the name of the room?
     Allows you to rename the room, keeping all the messages in that
     room and changing the room name in the table file.

3*0   3D0-irectory Room:- Do you want this an upload/download room?
     Creating download/upload rooms allows you and your users to
     exchange Public domain software and text files.  You can have only 255
     files in each directory room.
            If it is a new directory room, system will show following
            response:
               No Drive and Path
     This means that there is no drive letter or dos path to the drive.
               Enter Path- Enter drive and path : C:\bbs\name of directory
     When you create a new directory it should be on the drive that
     your system files are in.  Directories can be named the same way
     that you do when you create them from dos.
            The system will show following response:
               C:\bbs\name of directory does not exists.
               Create:(Y/N)[N]- Do you really want this created?
     When you answer with "Y", the system will create the directory path,
     just like dos does.  It will not update any dos tree information if
     you use a directory tree program.
     After creating the directory room it will prompt you if you want
      "3D0ownload only?"- This means anyone can download the files that are
       in this area, but can not upload anything.
      "3U0pload only?"- Same as download, this time the system will allow
       only uploads and no downloads in this area.

     3D0-isplay Room Descriptions:- Do you want room descriptions on?
     Room descriptions are normally found in rooms that have a specific
     topic, or if you want a message decribing the room's usage.
            If [Y], system will respond:
                Enter Room description filename
                     Must have (filename.ext)
     You can write your room description in any word proccessor program,
     and or any ascii program.  Room description files must be found in
     the #ROOMPATH as found in your Config.cit file.

     3C0-hange Group:- Do you want to change the group that can
                    access this room?
     Allows you to change the defaulted group of this room to a specified
     group.  If you do not have access to the group you are changing the
     room to, the room will appear to be not there in the hallway.
     A group only room will have a : at the end of the room name.
     EXAMPLE- Magic:
     If the group is locked, you can not change the room to that group.
     To remove a group from a room, respond "Y" to change the group
     and type <CR> for the group name.  This will remove the group and
     make it a open room.

     3H0-idden:- Do you want it hidden or public?
     Making a room hidden will add a ) to the end of the room name.
     EXAMPLE-   Magic)
     The room will stay hidden until you type .Goto the complete name of
     the room.  Once you type the complete name, the room will not leave
     your known rooms, unless the name changes again.

     3I0-nfo Line:- This is an online information text for specific rooms.
     It differs from the "room Description" by allowing you to add into the
     room table it's self a small blurb about the room.  This will show up
     when a person does a .ki (known info) or a .kvi (known verbose info).
     Helps when you have a series of rooms that are connected.

     3M0-oderated:- Do you want to have this room moderated?
     If a room is to be moderated, all messages in that room will not show
     up for the regular user until they are released.  These rooms are
     normally used for stories, network rooms to limit the messages
     that are going over the net, and conversations that have a flow to them.

3*0   3N0-etworked/Shared:- Do you want this room to net?
     If a room is shared, any system that nets with you, that has the access
     to that particular room, can request that room to be netted with that
     particular system.  Unfortunately this can cause problems if a shared
     room is in a group area, but is a null group room.  The node that is
     requesting it can net it without the knowledge of the home system.
     In any shared room, an user that is not a netuser, all their messages
     will appear as moderated.

     3P0-ermenant:- Do you want this room to stay on the system?
     If you answer "Y" to this question, all rooms that are permenant will
     stay on the system when you hit your maximium room number.  Those that
     are not permenant will scroll off the room table and become nonexistant.
     If you want rooms to scroll due to lack of conversation, do not answer
     "Y".


     3R0-ead only:- Do you want the users to be able to read only in
                         this room?
     When a room is read only, the sysop is the only person allowed to
     post in that room.  Regular users can read the room, but are not allowed
     to post any messages, whether e-mail or open.

     3S0-ave:Confirm save and exit from room edit function.
               After finishing with editting the room, save all changes.

  3.AF0-ile set - Sets all files in (fileinfo.cit) that don't have comments.
     All directory rooms have a fileinfo.cit.  It contains all information
     about what is in that particular directory room.  Information of
     size, name of file, who uploaded it, and any comments.  This
     command allows you to set all uncommented files in that directory
     room.

  3.AG0-roup fn - Add/Remove access of user from specified group.
     An aide can only add/remove someone to a group that is not locked from
     aides.  A locked group simply means that the sysop does not want
     the aides to add/remove themselves or others to and from that
     group for some reason.

  3.AH0-allway fn - Add/Remove room from hallway.
    This allows you to add/remove a room from a hallway.  You can
    add a room to more than one hallway.  The main usage of this command
    is for moving rooms from one hallway to another, without loosing
    all the messages in that room.
    Another use of this command is normally found when a system has
    more than one maintenance area.  Sometimes rooms are put in
    separate maintenance areas to allow specific aides to assist in
    helping that particular area of the board.
    Also if you want to have a room in more than one hallway for better
    coverage.  The only time a room will show up in two places at the
    beginning, is when you first create a room.  You will find it in
    the hallway you created it, and you will always find it in the
    maintenance hallway.

  3.AI0-nsert message - Insert last >k<illed (pulled) message into
                   current room.
    This allows you to insert a pulled message into the proper area.
    Sometimes a user will post a message into a specific room that
    the message doesn't belong in.  This command allows you to move
    this message to a more appropriate room.

 *3.AK0-ill room - Deletes room from system
    When killing a room, make sure that if it is a windowed room to
    unwindow it first.  Then kill the room.  All messages will be
    destroyed,but a copy of those messages can be found in Dump.
    When killing hallways, always kill the rooms that are in the
    hallway first. After killing all the rooms in the hallway, unwindow
    the last room and then kill it.  Then you may remove the hall.

  3.AL0-ist group - List all groups.
    If you are an aide only, you will see only those groups that are
    not locked from aides.  If you are a sysop/aide, you will see all
    groups that are on the system.
              - List specific group.
              includes all users, rooms and hallways with that access.
    If you want to find out who is in a specific group, at the end of the
    line, type the name of the group.  If it isn't locked,(if you are only
    an aide), it will list out all users that are in the group, the rooms
    the groups owns, and any hallways that the group has specific access to.

  3.AR0-ename file - Rename a file in directory room.
  Let's you rename any file in a directory room to a new name.

  3.AS0-et file info - Sets comments in (Fileinfo.cit) for a specific file.
  Similiar to the .Af command, this function will allow you to set
  comments about the file in fileinfo.cit.  Since sometimes you
  might drop in files into the directory from dos, you will need to
  set the comments in the fileinfo.cit so users can find out what
  the files are.  Also used when a fileinfo.cit is destroyed.
  Or when you want to change an existing comment.

  3.AU0-nlink File - Removes file from directory room.
  Kills a file off the drive, and deletes the entry in the fileinfo.cit.

  3.AV0-iew Help Text File - Views this text file (aide.blb)
  Views the text file from within the aide command line.

  3.AW0-indow hallway -Windows a room into a hallway.
  The system will prompt you with either:
  WINDOW(Y/N)[N] if the room is not windowed to anything.
  UNWINDOW(Y/N)[N] if the room is windowed to anything.
  Windowing and unwindowing rooms to and from a hallway can be tricky.
  When windowing a room, the room now becomes a way to enter any hallway it
  is connected to.
  When unwindowing a room, the room no longer has access to the other
  hallways it was connected to and or creates a one-way exit, allowing
  you to make a room that technically disappears from the users .kr command.
  In other words it can create havoc if properly used in a maze type setup.




3 MISC Commands:0

 Messages:
 A moderated message is a message that only the aides and/or sysops can
 see.
 For Sysops: To set the system to only allow sysops to see and
 release any moderated message, set in "Config.cit" #MODERATED to 0

 There are three ways a message will be a moderated message.  One is the
 problem user, one is the non-net user, and the last is in a moderated room.
 All these messages will have the same "Release (Y/N)[N]" message at the
 end of the message.  The only difference is that the non-net user's message
 will only show this response in a shared room.  A Problem user messages's
 will all have the response after each one he/she has left.  And a moderated
 room, all users posting in there will have this response at the end of each
 message.
 To release any of the messages, answer "Y" at the prompt.

 Killing a message is another function of an user /aide/sysop.
 For Sysops: To set system to only allowing aides and sysops to kill
 messages, set in "Config.cit" #KILL to 0.
 To kill any message other than private e-mail, type "k" during the message
 you want to remove.  The message will print out again and you will be asked
 "PULL (Y/N)[N]", which is asking you to confirm your choice. At this point
 the message will appear in the aide room.   You can only pull one message
 at a time if you want to insert it.  To defeat the repeat of the message,
 hit "n" and it will directly ask you "PULL (Y/N)[N]".  After killing a
 message, if you want to insert that message into another room, goto the
 room that you want to insert it in, and hit ".ai"(see aide insert command).

ROOMS:
 Rooms can be created by user/aides/sysops.
 For sysops: To set system to allow only aides and sysops to create a room,
 set in "Config.cit"  #ROOMOK to 1.  If you only want sysops to create a room
 set #ROOMOK to 2.
 When creating a room, the system will prompt you the following:
       Enter name for new room: Must be under 20 characters long.
       Make room public (Y/N)[Y]: Can make it either hidden or public.
       Install "name of the room" as a public room (Y/N)[N]: Allows
       you to not create the room if a mistake has been made.

 At this point  >.ae< or just hitting >a< will allow you to edit the room
 more thoroughly. (See .ae command).

3*0:Designates Sysop only functions
