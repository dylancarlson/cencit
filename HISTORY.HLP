 CITADEL -- updated 90 Feb 05 -------
   Citadel is a set of BBS/GDS (Bulletin Board System/General Discussion
System) software systems. The concept of Citadel is to divide the messages
placed on the system into natural divisions, at the discretion of the
authors of the messages, and to use the metaphor of rooms to do so.
 
   The Citadel concept drives several versions of BBS/GDS software that
have been written for:
   o certain 8-bit CP/M systems,
   o IBM PCs and clones running MS/PC-DOS 2.x and 3.x,
   o Commodore Amiga systems,
   o Atari ST systems,
   o Atari 800XL systems.
 
 Citadel History
 ---------------
   Citadel's direct predecessor was an Adventure program named "DanDe.pas" that
existed on a University of Washington computer system. Very similar to the
Zork series of games, DanDe.pas's innovation that carried over to Citadel
was the ability to leave messages on the "walls" of rooms; the messages
functioned to prove that the author of the message had actually made it
to the room, some of which were hard to find, thus according status to the
finders.
 
   The concept proved so popular that DanDe.pas was eventually banned from
the computer system; such are the rewards of being the most popular program
on line!
 
   The original author of Citadel was a gentleman who used the alias "Cynbe
ru Taren".  He borrowed the concept of "rooms" from DanDe.pas as a reaction
to the systems that were currently available -- linear systems that supported
one single list of messages to read, which could only be read forward
and backward.  Recognizing that it was the design of such systems that
encouraged "discussions" that tended to leapfrog and thus become fragmented,
he designed Citadel as a collection of "rooms", a familiar metaphor to 99%
of civilization, and provided several ways of easily accessing messages.
The room concept provided a convenient, understandable method for sensibly
separating discussions.
 
   To this strong concept he added a consistent command structure which
featured mnemonic single stroke commands available for the most popular
and safest commands. The more obscure, dangerous, or simply unused commands
were hidden from the fingers of unknowing novices by allowing access to them
through the use of a "command prefix" -- i.e., typing a '.' would allow
access to the advanced commands that users would not need as single stroke
commands.
 
   Cynbe wrote the original Citadel program in December of 1980, and left it
running over the holiday weekend - to find many favorable comments from the
users who'd found it.
 
   The original Citadel node, ODD-DATA, lasted for about six months;
a hardware failure forced it offline. By the time the hardware was repaired,
Cynbe had found better uses for his computer, but didn't want to let the code
go unused. He posted it on another bulletin board (John Rivoire's
MAILBOARD), and it started out into the world.
 
   He also kept tinkering with both the code and the design, with the help
of another Seattlite, Glenn Gorman.  However, with the release of Version 2.0
of the CP/M Citadel code (not to be confused with the C-86 version numbers,
which are an entirely different ball of wax), Cynbe retired permanently
from the BBS scene due to a large squabble that erupted in the Seattle
area in mid 1982, for which he felt (erroneously, in my opinion) personally
responsible.
 
   One of his final acts was to deliver the V2.0 code to T'an T'u, who put
up Polaris Citadel.  The code was posted publicly for download, and the
distribution started.  One of the features of V2.0 was the addition of
the Mail room, and restructuring of the data base.
 
 Citadel Distribution
 --------------------
   The CP/M version of the code has appeared since then (normally version
2.10) in a number of places, such as the CP/M SIG libraries, Fido download
systems, CUG libraries, and the like, and the code has become a hotbed for
experimentation with the code and concepts involved in Citadel.
 
   While a huge number of both fragmentary and complete installations of
Citadel have spread throughout the country, there are known to be at least
3 major geographic areas where Citadel continues to thrive, grow, and evolve.
While the participants are numerous, what follows will be a brief summary.
 
   West Coast:
   -----------
   The biggest center for room-based systems is based in Seattle, where
a Citadel-derivative called Stonehenge, written by David Bonn, is by far
the most popular.  He has extended the original Citadel with the concept
of "hallways," along with destroying the Mail> room.  There are also a number
of MiniBin systems in the Seattle area, and several Citadels that are supported
by The Gremlin.
 
   Another active area on the West Coast is the Sacramento, CA area, where
a number of Citadels and derivatives thrive.
 
   East Coast:
   -----------
   The three main Citadels on the East Coast appear to be MorningStar Keep,
led by Brian Riley, Sony Citadel, shepherded by Andy Meyer, and Brick Citadel,
run by Ted Mozer.  These three are descended from V2.10 code obtained from
the CP/M SIG, and have been substantially debugged and enhanced since then
by Brian and Andy, with help from others.  Andy has supplied a version to
Japan, where the installation is reportedly up and running; Brian, also,
has distributed versions.
 
   The East Coast Citadels have been far more conservative than the West
Coast, retaining the Mail room, and making few extensions to the concepts
or command set of the original Citadel.  A result is that their systems tend
to be very stable.
 
   Midwest:
   --------
   The third major enclave of Citadel seems to be situated in the Twin Cities
area of Minnesota (although there are at least two Citadels in North Dakota).
Citadel originally came to the Twin Cities under the auspices of the SuperComp
club of Sperry-UNIVAC Corporation (now known as >gag< UNISYS),
when, at the urging of Jeff Vosburg (Vosburg the Wise) and Steve Berlin, Ray
Schneider (aka The Conductor) ordered and paid for Citadel from the CUG (C
Users Group), and received CP/M Citadel V2.10. Vosburg hacked at the buggy
code for a short while, and then the code was passed onto John Stanley and
Hue, Jr.  The code was slowly debugged annd enhanced over the summer of '84.
 
   In the Fall of '84, an effort was made by Hue, Jr., with the assistance of
John Stanley, to port Citadel to the MS-DOS side of a Zenith Z-100.  This
resulted in the Citadel-86 (name nominated by Lord Castleregh and confirmed
by the users of Test System) version of Citadel for MS-DOS systems;
subsequently, Citadel-86 was modified to run on IBMs and Clones.
 
   The philosophy for development in the Twin Cities has had two facets.
   1) Extensions fit in with the concepts ("magic") of Citadel;
   2) User suggestions play a strong, if not overpowering, part in the process.
 
   This has resulted in no major changes in the basic Citadel structure; new
commands have enhanced Citadel's structure and useability.
 
   Citadel-86 also supports an active network facility, which allows the
transmission and reception of files, netMail, and room sharing.
 
   As of 1988-90 a stable version of Citadel Maintained by Gremlin (v1.27)
has been enhanced to include networking to other Citadels and has been 
split between two parties with two new names: DragCit and TurboCit. Both 
Citadels now have been converted from the original Microsoft C code to 
Turbo C and do support com3 and com4.  Also included in both boards is 
support of ANSI-BBS terminal emulation and IBM Graphics characters to keep 
pace with the current BBS technology.  DragCit and has been split further: 
TwitCit, FrogCit, MavenCit and some others I can't remember. Frecit is 
derived from TurboCit and CenCit is derived from FredCit. Other new 
enhancements continue to be added and are being tested in Seattle and 
California.  Some testing is going on at this site.

 DERIVATIVES
 -----------
   Citadel has inspired a number of clones.  Nationally known is Minibin,
written in BASIC by Glenn Gorman of Seattle.
 
   In the Twin Cities area, Lum the Mad has written Citadel-65 in BASIC,
Major Tom modified existing BASIC code into PsuedoDel, and Hue, Sr. has
written NeoCitadel in Turbo Pascal.  There is a Cit-Ux multi-user version
running under Unix V.  There are undoubtedly other derivatives floating around
in other parts of the country; others are known to be planned, using such
diverse languages as Assembly and COBOL.
 
 INTERNATIONAL
 -------------
   There are reports of Citadel code making it to Kuwait; Andy Meyer has an
installation of his code running in Japan; and there are rumors of an
installation in Australia.
 
 CURRENTLY
 ---------
   A coherent summary would be impossible in the space available;
generalizations are probably best.  Citadel's tradition is that source code
be made available on request, and that tradition is held to whenever possible
apparently.  On the West Coast, evolution is fast and drastic; on the East
Coast, very slow (due to being hosted on CP/M systems limited to 64K program
space, unlike the Citadel-86 systems); in the Twin Cities, it follows the
whims of John Stanley and Hue, Jr., being blown by their own winds and
the suggestions of the users.
 
   Many great Citadels have come and gone.  In the Twin City area, these
include SuperComp (now reincarnated in Hue Sr.'s SuperComp II running
NeoCitadel), Tralfamador, and Just Another Citadel; undoubtedly, other areas
of the USA have lost and lamented Citadels.  They tend to be friendly
places....
